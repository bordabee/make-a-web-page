          		</div>
          		<div class="concept-description">
          			<p>The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents.
          			<br>HTML stands for <span class="italic">HyperText Markup Language</span>, this is the basis for the
          			majority of web pages. 
          			<br>HTML is what connects most types of documents together through hyperlinks. 
          			HTML can be made up of text content (what you see), markup (arrangement of content), 
          			references to other documents, and links to other pages.

          		<p>
          			Programmers need to write in a language a computer understands;
          			this way a computer can follow the instructions the programmer wrote. 
          			<br>Therefore, in order to be precised, it is imperative to use the right syntax.

          			<span class= "italic">Anchor tags</span>: adds a link to a text or word. When clicked, it directs you to another page. <br>
            		<span class="italic">Image tags</span>: adds a link to an image. Another page is opened when the image is linked. <br>
            		<span class="italic">Whitespace</span>: text on multiple lines using the break tag (void tag) or the paragraph tag (not a void tag). <br>
            		<span class="italic">Inline/Block</span>: an inline tag tells when a line ends, while a block tag creates an invisible box. 
            		Examples of inline tags include the anchor, span, break, image, and strong tags. While the paragraph and div tags are types of block tags.
